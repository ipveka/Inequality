# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Python-based web application using Streamlit to visualize the Gini index (a measure of income inequality) over time by country. The application will fetch real-time data from a reliable API source and provide interactive visualizations and tabular data to help users understand inequality trends across different countries and time periods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher or policy analyst, I want to select a specific country from a dropdown menu, so that I can focus my analysis on inequality trends for that particular nation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with a country selection dropdown
2. WHEN the dropdown is clicked THEN the system SHALL show all available countries from the data source
3. WHEN a country is selected THEN the system SHALL update the visualizations to show data for that country only
4. IF no country is selected initially THEN the system SHALL display a default country or prompt for selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to view a line plot of Gini index evolution over time, so that I can visually identify trends and patterns in inequality for the selected country.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a country is selected THEN the system SHALL display a line plot showing Gini index values over available years
2. WHEN the plot is rendered THEN the system SHALL use a clear x-axis for years and y-axis for Gini index values
3. WHEN hovering over data points THEN the system SHALL display tooltips with exact year and Gini value
4. IF no data is available for a country THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
5. WHEN the plot is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper axis labels and title

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user analyzing inequality data, I want to see a detailed table with Gini values by year below the chart, so that I can examine specific numerical values and perform detailed analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a country is selected THEN the system SHALL display a table showing year and corresponding Gini index values
2. WHEN the table is rendered THEN the system SHALL sort data chronologically by year
3. WHEN displaying values THEN the system SHALL format Gini index values to appropriate decimal places
4. IF data is missing for certain years THEN the system SHALL handle missing values appropriately
5. WHEN the table is shown THEN the system SHALL include clear column headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want the application to use real, reliable data from established sources like World Bank or OECD, so that the analysis is based on authoritative and current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a reliable API source (World Bank, OECD, etc.)
2. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL retrieve actual Gini index data, not sample or static data
3. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache or handle data efficiently to avoid excessive API calls
5. IF API rate limits exist THEN the system SHALL respect those limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want the code to be modular, clear, and well-documented, so that it can be easily understood, modified, and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have separate modules for data fetching, visualization, and UI components
2. WHEN examining functions THEN the system SHALL include clear docstrings and comments
3. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL start successfully with `streamlit run app.py`
4. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include a requirements.txt file with all necessary packages
5. WHEN reading the code THEN the system SHALL follow Python best practices and naming conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to use professional visualization libraries like plotly or matplotlib, so that the charts are interactive, visually appealing, and publication-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL use either plotly or matplotlib for chart generation
2. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL provide interactive features (zoom, pan, hover) if using plotly
3. WHEN rendering plots THEN the system SHALL ensure charts are responsive and properly sized
4. WHEN using pandas THEN the system SHALL leverage it for efficient data manipulation and processing
5. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate color schemes and styling
